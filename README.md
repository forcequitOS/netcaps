## A network activity light on your Caps Lock key. 
**Try it today, you'll love it, or your money back!**

### Install:
`brew tap forcequitOS/brew`

`brew install netcaps`

It couldn't get much simpler than this. 

To run netcaps automagically on startup, do:

`sudo brew services start netcaps`, or just `brew services start netcaps` to only run netcaps on your user account. 

All functionality of your Caps Lock key is 100% preserved with netcaps. Also, netcaps is proudly written using 100% Swift. Yay for me. 

I don't know if this will impact your battery life or if it'll kill your Caps Lock key LED over time. Your mileage may vary. I'm not responsible if this somehow blows up your computer, but it probably shouldn't. 

### Usage:

`netcaps [arguments]`

**Arguments:**

--silent, -s	- Silences command-line output

--version, -v	- Displays the current version of netcaps

--help, -h		- Shows the help menu

That really. Is about it. Have fun.
